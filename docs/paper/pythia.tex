\begin{abstract}
Web frameworks that allow developers
to create applications based on design
patterns such as the
{\it Model View Controller} ({\sc mvc}),
provide by default a number of security checks.
Nevertheless,
by using specific constructs,
developers may disable these checks
thus re-introducing classic application
vulnerabilities such as Cross-site Scripting
({\sc xss}) and Cross-Site Request Forgery
({\sc csrf}).
Framework-specific elements including
(1) the complex nature of these applications,
(2) the different features that they involve
(e.g. templates),
and (3) the inheritance mechanisms
that governs them,
make the identification
of such issues very difficult.

To tackle this problem,
we have developed {\it Pythia},
a scheme that analyzes applications
based on the {\it Django} framework.
To identify potentially dangerous
data flows that can lead to
{\sc xss} and {\sc csrf} defects,
Pythia takes into account all the
aforementioned elements and employs
ideas coming from standard
data-flow analysis and taint tracking schemes.
To the best of our knowledge,
Pythia is the first mechanism
to consider framework-specific
elements in its analysis.
We have evaluated our scheme
with positive results.
Specifically,
we used Pythia to examine five open-source
applications that are currently in production
and have thousands of users
including an e-voting service,
and a web-based translation
management system.
In four cases we have identified dangerous paths
that in turn led to vulnerabilities.
Notably,
in many cases the paths involved the
particular features of Django-based
applications e.g. templates.
